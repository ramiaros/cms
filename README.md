# CMS

CMS for community projects

## Installation

* Install wordpress with `https` supported domain. Or PWA and other things may not work.

* git clone `cms` theme inti `wp-content/themes` folder.
```text
$ cd wp-content/themes/
$ git clone https://github.com/thruthesky/cms
```

* activate the theme on admin panel.



## Tests

### PHP Unit Test

* Run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests` in `cms` folder.

* To watch, download [phprun](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phprun) and run like below.
```shell script
$ phprun vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```

## Development View

### Browser Support

* All major browser except Internet Explorer. The support of IE from MS will be ended by 2020.
  * Benefit of not supporting IE.
    * We can use Bootstrap 5.
    * We can use [Javascript Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

  * Chrome, Edge, Safari would be the major browsers.

### Installing Developer Tools & Live reload

* `cd wp-content/thtmes/cms`
* `npm i`
* Run below to watch & compile sass files into css.\
  `$ ./node_modules/.bin/sass --watch scss:css`
* Run below to live reload.\
  `$ node live-reload.js`


### Dev Environment, Tools & Components


​* Everything is saved in `cms` theme.
  * The PHP Restful Api is saved under `cms` theme folder to avoid multiple setup.

* Live reload is implemented with `Node.js` and `Socket.io`.
  * Whenever HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP has changed, it will reload the site.

* SCSS are saved in `cms/scss` and compiled into `css` folder.

* Bootstrap 5
  * And supporting `boostrap.js`, `popper.js` has been added.
  
* jQuery
  * The reason why we need jQuery is 1) to manipulate DOM 2) Ajax 3) we may need jQuery plugins like animations, form funtions.

* Fontawesome 5
  * Only for free version. The file size of pro version is too big.

* PHPUnit


* Node.js
  * For sass compilation, hot reload.


## Web/PWA Functionality

### PWA

* `manifest.json` exists on `cms` theme folder.
* App icons are saved under `cms/img/pwa` folder.
* `index.js` triggers installation of `Service Worker`.
    * The `cms/js/service-worker.php` file is the service worker.
    It's a PHP script that wraps Javascript for `service worker scope`.
* PWA start_url is pointing `cms/pwa-start.html` to avoid caching on the first page.



## Restful API

* JSON communication as Wordpress plugin system is some what tedious.
  * You have to follow Wordpress JSON rules and it's not easy to customize.
  * And you have to deal with the odd user authentication with Wordpress - the naunce.
  * After all, only admin can post/edit/delete and we need to hack it.
  * This is the reason why we made our own code and put it under `/wordpress-api-v2`.

* We will make our own code for this project.
  * We will put the code inside the theme. so, we don't have to manage the restful api code and the theme code separately.


## Coding Guidelines

* WEB/PWA development and design must follow bootstrap way.

* All form submits and form submit like actions should be made by `ajax` call.


### Javascript & jQuery

* When you need to listen on Javascript event with jquery, you can do it like below.
  Since jQuery is loaded at the bottom of the page, you can use jQuery within `load` event listener.
```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    $(function() {
        
    });
});
```

* When you don't have to use jQuery as listener, simply declare functions Javascript way like below.
 
 ```javascript
function onLoginFormSubmit(form) {
    console.log(form);
    console.log( $( form ).serialize() );
    return false;
}
```

* Javascript cookie is handled with [js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie).
  It is included at the bottom of `index.php` and available on all pages .

$ cd wp-content/themes/
$ git clone https://github.com/thruthesky/cms
```

* To watch, download [phprun](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phprun) and run like below.
```shell script

```

## Development

### Installing Developer Tools & Live reload

* `cd wp-content/thtmes/cms`
* `npm i`
* Run below to watch & compile sass files into css.\
  `$ ./node_modules/.bin/sass --watch scss:css`
* Run below to live reload.\
  `$ node live-reload.js`


### Dev Environment, Tools & Components


â€‹* Everything is saved in `cms` theme.
  * The PHP Restful Api is saved under `cms` theme folder to avoid multiple setup.

* Live reload is implemented with `Node.js` and `Socket.io`.
  * Whenever HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP has changed, it will reload the site.

* SCSS are saved in `cms/scss` and compiled into `css` folder.

* Bootstrap 5
  * And supporting `boostrap.js`, `popper.js` has been added.
  
* jQuery
  * The reason why we need jQuery is 1) to manipulate DOM 2) Ajax 3) we may need jQuery plugins like animations, form funtions.

* Fontawesome 5
  * Only for free version. The file size of pro version is too big.

* PHPUnit


* Node.js
  * For sass compilation, hot reload.


## Web/PWA Functionality

### PWA

* `manifest.json` exists on `cms` theme folder.
* App icons are saved under `cms/img/pwa` folder.
* `index.js` triggers installation of `Service Worker`.
    * The `cms/js/service-worker.php` file is the service worker.
    It's a PHP script that wraps Javascript for `service worker scope`.
* PWA start_url is pointing `cms/pwa-start.html` to avoid caching on the first page.



## Restful API

* JSON communication as Wordpress plugin system is some what tedious.
  * You have to follow Wordpress JSON rules and it's not easy to customize.
  * And you have to deal with the odd user authentication with Wordpress - the naunce.
  * After all, only admin can post/edit/delete and we need to hack it.
  * This is the reason why we made our own code and put it under `/wordpress-api-v2`.

* We will make our own code for this project.
  * We will put the code inside the theme. so, we don't have to manage the restful api code and the theme code separately.


## Coding Guidelines

* All form submits and form submit like actions should be made by `ajax` call.

```shell script
$ phprun vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```

## Development View

### Browser Support

* All major browser including Internet Explorer >= 10.
  * We are targeting browser support for the browser that Bootstrap 4 support.


### Installing Developer Tools & Live reload

* `cd wp-content/thtmes/cms`
* `npm i`
* Run below to watch & compile sass files into css.\
  `$ ./node_modules/.bin/sass --watch scss:css`
* Run below to live reload.\
  `$ node live-reload.js`
* PHP unit test.\
  See `PHP Unit Test` section.

### Dev Environment, Tools & Components


â€‹* Everything is saved in `cms` theme.
  * The PHP Restful Api is saved under `cms` theme folder to avoid multiple setup.

* Live reload is implemented with `Node.js` and `Socket.io`.
  * Whenever HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP has changed, it will reload the site.

* SCSS are saved in `cms/scss` and compiled into `css` folder.

* Bootstrap 4
  * And supporting javascripts.
  * Bootstrap 4 supports IE while Bootstrap 5 does not. So, we use Bootstrap 4 for Koreans.
  
* jQuery
  * The reason why we need jQuery is 1) to manipulate DOM 2) Ajax 3) we may need jQuery plugins like animations, form funtions.

* Fontawesome 5
  * Only for free version. The file size of pro version is too big.

* PHPUnit


* Node.js
  * For sass compilation, hot reload.


## Web/PWA Functionality

### PWA

* `manifest.json` exists on `cms` theme folder.
* App icons are saved under `cms/img/pwa` folder.
* `index.js` triggers installation of `Service Worker`.
    * The `cms/js/service-worker.php` file is the service worker.
    It's a PHP script that wraps Javascript for `service worker scope`.
* PWA start_url is pointing `cms/pwa-start.html` to avoid caching on the first page.



## Restful API

* JSON communication as Wordpress plugin system is some what tedious.
  * You have to follow Wordpress JSON rules and it's not easy to customize.
  * And you have to deal with the odd user authentication with Wordpress - the naunce.
  * After all, only admin can post/edit/delete and we need to hack it.
  * This is the reason why we made our own code and put it under `/wordpress-api-v2`.

* We will make our own code for this project.
  * We will put the code inside the theme. so, we don't have to manage the restful api code and the theme code separately.

### Restful API Protocol

* To work with Wordpress backend, you need to install `cms` theme properly.
  * And you can test the API protocol by sending it through web browser address input.
  * Ex) `https://wordpress.philgo.com/wp-content/themes/cms/api.php?route=app.version`
  * Note: The API address must be replaced by your own Wordpress site address.

* Get version of API

```html
route=app.version
```

* Registration

```html
route=user.register&user_email=auser1598245597@test.com&user_pass=PW.test@,*&nickname=MyNick&meta_a=Apple
```

* Login

```html
route=user.login&user_email=user1598245099@test.com&user_pass=PW.test@,*
```

* User update
```html
?route=user.update&session_id=31_59c9bb43b7aeac9ee6b3fcb8daccafba&nickname=abc&meta1=a
```

* Resign
```html
?route=user.resign&session_id=31_59c9bb43b7aeac9ee6b3fcb8daccafba
```



## Coding Guidelines

* WEB/PWA development and design must follow bootstrap way.

* All form submits and form submit like actions should be made by `ajax` call.


### Javascript & jQuery

* When you need to listen on Javascript event with jquery, you can do it like below.
  Since jQuery is loaded at the bottom of the page, you can use jQuery within `load` event listener.
```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    $(function() {
        
    });
});
```

* When you don't have to use jQuery as listener, simply declare functions Javascript way like below.
 
 ```javascript
function onLoginFormSubmit(form) {
    console.log(form);
    console.log( $( form ).serialize() );
    return false;
}
```

* Javascript cookie is handled with [js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie).
  It is included at the bottom of `index.php` and available on all pages .
  
  
  
  ### Pages & Widgets
  
  * Each domain can have a different theme.
    * Pages as theme design are saved under 'pages/[domain]' folder.
    * You can update the domain settings in `Config` folder.
